## Brainstorming and Outlining

- Title of the game (undetermined, used "A Game, Maybe?" as a working title)
- ~~Text based adventure more focused on storytelling~~ I lied. It's the dino game.
- ~~The main idea is to have it a horizontal scroller. The player doesn't control any of the avatars and most of it is done through the text/dialog choices.~~
- ~~If that fails, just a simple text with button.~~
- AND if THAT fails, ~~matching~~ dino game as a last resort.
- ~~Want something that can possibly be expanded into and actual game later on (this is probably overly ambitious of me.)~~
- ~~Need to find a way to effectively make a dialog box the way I envisioned it. However, if that doesn't work then result to simple div with animation.~~

~~Preface of the Game (not set in stone, mostly complete):
> You are trapped in a maze of your own memories. The player must go through, searching through all of their memories in an attempt to find the memory of how they got trapped here, as their only course of escape. Multiple endings based on the choices of the player and how their actions influence and expose the main character to painful, happy and even traumatic events from their past they've forgotten since entering the maze. The player is building a new character based on what memories they select for them and expose them to. This game aims to act as an introspective of how our memories build us as who we are today and what happens when we lose control to outside forces, in this case the player, of our memories and what would happen to us.~~

### Possible Engines

- Bitsy (user friendly, favorite, however must find a way to separate the elements into different files)
- Twine (prior knowledge for using it, been awhile but also need to find a way to separate elements)
- pixelbox.js (seems easy to use and in the vein of the style I'm going for)
- kaboom.js (I like that it shows the script out for you, so it's easy to learn. However the style is not the kind of thing I'm looking for)
