# Dino Game, But Different
Hello! And welcome to my Milestone Project. The theme of the game is: Dino game....but Different™️. An endless jumper that has no win condition.

### Controls
The controls of the game are simple:
- W, Space, or Up Arrow to jump
- any key to start/restart.

### Inspiration
The inspiration for this game is solely based on the Chrome Dino jump game that happens when you have no internet. I wanted to create a replica of it but with my own kind of modern like twist!

### About The Project
Initially? This project wasn't supposed to be Dino game. I wanted to create a more text based adventure -- but when I figured the code for the logic and the many branches of story it would take; I took a simplier route.

Now this isn't to say that Dino game *isn't* complicated coding. Because let me tell you, there was a lot of complicated coding. For one, I wanted to resize the game while still keep it in the center. When I tried coding that, it would just fill the entirely browser window dynamically. Which hey, is great -- but also not great when your background and trees aren't scaling with your dino and obstacles. While the game functions, there's still a lot of bugs that aren't quite fixed.

When I had friends "beta test" the game, we had quite a hilarious time. For one, the logic was that the game speed should run at the same refresh rate as your display monitor. This led to some dinos ZOOMING at quantum speeds, breaking figurative barriers. As something being shared among friends? I kept the cute charm of surprise sonic speed dino.
